\chapter{Testing}\label{ch:test}
This chapter should have assessed the correct functioning and performance of the two-way ranging and position estimator.

However, since the positioning-related features have been left unimplemented, it will provide a mere trace of the current status of accomplishment of the requirements.
Information about the ranging performances is available on the \nameref{sec:concl_prod}.

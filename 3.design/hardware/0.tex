\section{Hardware}\label{sec:hardware}

This section will present the hardware architecture of the system, focusing on both large-scale aspect and individual components/subsystems.

The board design consists in a single PCB built around the decaWave DWM1000 ultra-wideband radio module.
It also includes a with a microcontroller, CAN and USB interfaces, and secondary sensors.
At least four of them are necessary for a complete system and since the anchors are stationary, they do not require the secondary sensors to be populated.

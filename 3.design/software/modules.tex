\subsubsection{Board layer}


\subsubsection{decaWave drivers}

The bus configuration (sampling polarity and phase) can be customized by manipulating

\subsubsection{Configuration manager}
Stores and retrieves settings of arbitrary type.
Needed by pretty much anything.
Will be implemented on top of EEPROM since it's the only available permanent, user-writtable memory (Flash is too, but on a page-basis).

\subsubsection{Command line interface}
Used for providing runtime infos and changing settings without the need of a debugger probe.
Will read from UART.

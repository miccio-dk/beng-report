\subsection{Software modules}



\subsubsection{decaWave module}
Abstraction layer to its registers and functionalities.
May consist in the APIs provided by the IC supplier.

\subsubsection{Processes manager}
Executes different tasks at required time intervals, monitors their return values, collects statistics.
Explain differences between normal tasks and idle task.

\subsubsection{Configuration manager}
Stores and retrieves settings of arbitrary type.
Needed by pretty much anything.
Will be implemented on top of EEPROM since it's the only available permanent, user-writtable memory (Flash is too, but on a page-basis).

\subsubsection{Command line interface}
Used for providing runtime infos and changing settings without the need of a debugger probe.
Will read from UART.

\subsubsection{Time tracking}
Provides time tracking and management capabilities (virtual timeouts and stopwatches, delays).
Needed by UAVCAN and processes manager.
May be POSIX-compliant, if strictly necessary.
May be implemented through the RTC and timers peripherals or decaWave timestamps system.

\subsubsection{System self-test}
Verifies correct state of operation and data integrity.
Needed by UAVCAN (every node shall broadcast its state).

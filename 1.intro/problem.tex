\section{Problem formulation}\label{sec:problem_formulation}

The aim of the project is to design and develop a UAVCAN-compatible indoor positioning system for aerial unmanned veicles (UAVs) based on the decaWave DWM1000 devices.
Using these radio modules, an algorithm shall be devised and implemented in order to estimate the UAV position in a 2D coordinate system.
The resulting information is to be broadcasted through the UAVCAN bus --- a message definition shall be choosen amongst the pool of standard definitions, or designed from scratch.

The performance of the system ought to be in line with DecaWave's claims in term of maximum accuracy and range, and the device has to be suitable for battery operation.
Moreover, the system shall comply with the UAVCAN specifications and support its major standard functionalities.

The project is carried out in collaboration with \emph{UAVComponents ApS}, which will lend its expertise in hardware design and provide the necessary development tools.

\section{Rationale}

From map-making to post tracking, localization has been a fundamental human endeavor which encompassed several ages and civilizations.
Although GPS has proven to be a major leap is this regard, its current limitations causes it to be unsuitable for some applications.
First of all, the accuracy lays in the order of a few meters at best, mainly due to the relativistic implication of orbiting satellites \cite{gps1} (that is without considering more advanced techniques such as \emph{RTK}).
Moreover, signal shadowing and multi-path reflections renders it particularly unreliable indoor or in dense urban areas.
In order to fulfill the ever-growing demand for automation, more precise systems have to be employed.

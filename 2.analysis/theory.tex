\subsection{Ranging algorithm}
Description of single-sided two-way ranging and double-sided two-way ranging mechanism.
May also include notions of IEEE 802.15.4 (PHY and MAC layer).

\subsection{Position estimation}
Explanation of the triangulation algorithms.

\subsection{CAN Bus}
Brief explanation of CAN protocol, its history, and principles of operation.
May also be opted out and substituted with notions of ARM Cortex-M architecture.

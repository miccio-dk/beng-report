\chapter{Problem analysis}\label{ch:analysis}

The following sections aim to elaborate on the \nameref{sec:problem} and create a more solid base to use as a guideline and template during the actual development.
The adopted framework is based upon the one presented during the course of the studies \cite{up} and bear similarities with the \emph{Unified Software Development Process}.

This analysis does not aspire to be exhaustive, but rather satisfactory in the level of detail required to establish the project.

\section{Requirements specification}\label{sec:reqs}
The \emph{software requirements specification} is the formal description of the system to be developed, thoroughly describing what the product is --- and is not --- expected to do.
It also helps assessing the extent of the endeavor in terms of workload, cost, and other resources.
The requirements are commonly laid out in agreement with the client, and provide the basis upon which the product or project is evaluated.

As far as this project is concerned, the company has not set any particular requirements apart from those implied in the project name.
The list of requirements is therefore mostly based on former knowledge, common sense and best practices within the industry,


\subsection{Functional requirements}\label{subsec:req_func}
This section defines specific behaviors or functionalities, and is the basis for the tests.
Requirements introduced by the modal verb \emph{shall} indicate mandatory conditions, whilst those introduced by the modal verb \emph{may} indicate optional features.

For conciseness and clarity sake, along with tag and anchor, the concept of \emph{device}is also introduced.
Requirements specified for the device are to be fulfilled by both elements.

\subsection{Use cases}\label{subsec:u_cases}
This section describes how the actors can interact with the system.
Since the product is meant to be used in an unmanned and autonomous environment, the definition of actor becomes quite loose.
The identified actors are the AUV autopilot and the final user.

As most of the identified use case are tightly couple with a functional requirements, they have been grouped and cross-referenced.

\section{Milestone plan}

Here is the project milestone plan as formulated during the \emph{Inception} and \emph{Elaboration} phases.
This version of the plan lists a series of achievements deemed necessary to accomplish the major functionalities.
It is arranged in a progressive way, with a time axis roughly flowing vertically.
Each task depends from its sub-tasks and --- more indirectly --- on the previous ones sharing its hierarchy level.

Although it has been used --- together with the previously discussed \nameref{subsec:u_cases} --- as blabla, casini vari

Please refer to the \nameref{app:0} for the final version of the milestone plan based on the actual project development.


This section should be based on the following (sorted out) milestone plan. It should also refer to the conclusions and appendices for remarks and detailed logs.

\begin{enumerate}
\item get the modules to work (Arduino, mbed)

\item schematics design
\item software development
	\begin{enumerate}

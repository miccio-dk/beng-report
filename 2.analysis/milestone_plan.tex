\section{Milestone plan}

Here is the project milestone plan as formulated during the \emph{Inception} and \emph{Elaboration} phases.
This version of the plan lists a series of achievements deemed necessary to accomplish the major functionalities.
It is arranged in a progressive way, with a time axis roughly flowing vertically.
Each task depends from its sub-tasks and --- more indirectly --- on the previous ones within its hierarchal level.

Although it has been used --- together with the previously discussed \nameref{subsec:u_cases} --- as a reference for the project implementation, unforeseen difficulties have caused the development to drift considerably from the plan.

Please refer to the \nameref{app:0} for the final version of the milestone plan based on the actual progress.

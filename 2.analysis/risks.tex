\section{Risk management}

Risk assessment and management are well-established disciplines amongst many fields of engineering and other areas of human endeavor, and represent a way of minimizing the probability and impact of adverse conditions in a given context.

In the \nameref{subsec:overview} subsection, possible sources of hindrance are categorized and listed.
Preventive measures are then suggested in the \nameref{subsec:prevention} subsection.


\subsection{Description}
This section acts as a legend, providing the necessary information for interpreting the subsequent risk assessment.
Risks are evaluated according to their composite risk index (\emph{CRI}):
\begin{equation}
    \textit{CRI} = \textit{Severity} \times \textit{Probability of occurrence}
\end{equation}
The CRI represents the degree of importance of each entry.
Entries with a high (ie. red-leaning) CRI shall have maximum priority.

Traditionally, this kind of analysis involves assigning a numeric value from an arbitrarily chosen range to each variable --- e.g. 1--5 for the severity and 0--100\% for the probability.
However, educated estimations require solid data and a tracked history of previous occurrences, all of which were either not available or difficult to obtain with the necessary degree of confidence. \cite{risk}
Therefore, the final value of the CRI has been neglected in favor of a color-mapped matrix composed of four sub-ranges.
Whilst selecting these sub-ranges, higher ``granularity'' has been given to the more adverse scenarios.

\subsection{Risk assessment}\label{subsec:overview}
Follows the lists of threats (divided by category) with associated likelihood, impact, and overall CRI.
The risk index is accompanied with the affected resource(s), chosen amongst:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Product \textbf{F}unctionality
    \item Project \textbf{C}ost
    \item Development \textbf{T}ime
\end{itemize}
Whenever possible or necessary, a brief explanation of the predicted consequences is given.

\subsubsection{Hardware}
The estimations are based on company personnel's knowledge and previous experience with the given components and communication protocols governing them.
For the purpose in this analysis the board components have been divided in primary (microcontroller, decaWave module, CAN transciever) and secondary (power supply unit, other sensors, USB interface), based on their importance for the fulfillment of the project.
